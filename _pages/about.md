Papers are the main way of disseminating cutting-edge results in science. 
We write papers so that we can pass on our knowledge to other researchers, practitioners, and to those interested in the field. 

But what happens when you realize you’ve made a mistake in a paper, or you’ve discovered limitations of your approach, or you’ve thought of some new intuition or simpler explanation for motivating your work? In research, this is pretty common. While there are several ways to respond to these realizations (adding a footnote or appendix, writing a blog post, tweeting about it), often they are simply ignored. 

Retrospectives are an avenue for authors to talk about the shortcomings, errors, or other changes to their previous papers. A retrospective is written for a single paper, by an author of the original paper. The goal of a retrospective is to answer the question: “What should readers of this paper know now, that isn’t in the original paper?” We’re still exploring what forms retrospectives can take, but for now they can be thought of as short blog posts.

*The ultimate goal of retrospectives is to do better science, increase the openness and accessibility of the machine learning field, and to show that it’s okay to make mistakes.*
