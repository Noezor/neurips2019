description: A venue for self-reflection in machine learning research
---


The NeurIPS Retrospectives Workshop is different from a usual workshop. While most workshops promote discussion of work in a specific subfield, this workshop aims to promote a specific kind of scholarship: reflecting on your own previous work. 

There are two tracks for submissions to the workshop (see: [call for papers](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2019/cfp/)):

1. **Retrospectives track.** *Retrospectives* are a new form of publication where authors write a critical analysis of one of their own past papers. This can include new perspectives on the work since publication, a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the work, or acknowledgement of errors in the original manuscript. The goal is to be as open and honest about your past work as possible.   
2. **Meta-analysis track.** We also encourage the submission of *meta-analyses* of a small set of related papers (not necessarily your own). This can include observations of recent trends, a discussion of changes to the ‘common knowledge’ in the field, or something else. The goal is to provide insights or new perspectives around a unified theme.  

Submissions can be from any subfield of machine learning or related fields of interest to the NeurIPS community, including neuroscience and statistics.  The main goal of the workshop is to introduce researchers to more public reflections of their work as part of an ongoing effort to disseminate scientific knowledge more effectively and openly. 

We are accompanying the workshop with the open-source release of a retrospectives platform on GitHub called [ML Retrospectives](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/), which will host retrospective submissions going forward after NeurIPS 2019.
